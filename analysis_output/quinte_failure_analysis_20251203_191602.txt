Races analyzed: 66
Total predictions: 1034

KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. POSITION 4-5 PERFORMANCE:
   - Position 4 success rate: 37.9% (drift: +3.21)
   - Position 5 success rate: 49.1% (drift: +0.96)
   ⚠ CRITICAL: Positions 4-5 have low success rates (<70%)
   → Consider increasing margin/uncertainty for these positions
   → May need separate model or additional features for mid-pack positions

2. WINNER CORRECT BUT QUINTÉ MISSED:
   - Occurs in 22/65 races (33.8%)
   ✓ Good winner prediction but struggling with full top 5
   → Focus on improving positions 2-5, not position 1

3. FAVORITE VS OUTSIDER BIAS:
   Favorite (≤5):
     - Drift: +1.48 (+ = overestimate)
     - Precision: 84.1%, Recall: 100.0%
   Mid-range (5-15):
     - Drift: -0.28 (+ = overestimate)
     - Precision: 59.7%, Recall: 54.1%
   Outsider (>15):
     - Drift: -1.63 (+ = overestimate)
     - Precision: 28.0%, Recall: 18.6%
   ⚠ WARNING: Over-predicting favorites (drift: +1.48)
   → Reduce weight on recent form, increase weight on race conditions
   ⚠ WARNING: Under-predicting outsiders (drift: -1.63)
   → Consider adding upset potential features

4. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
   a) Implement position-specific models or calibration
   b) Add features that capture mid-pack dynamics (positions 4-8)
   c) Consider ensemble approach: winner model + placer model
   d) Investigate race-specific patterns (track, distance, surface)
   e) Add uncertainty quantification to identify risky predictions
